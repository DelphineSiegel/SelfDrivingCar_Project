  Motor.py, PCA9685.py and servo.py have been provided by Freenove, as it is needed to build the car. 
  ObjectAvoid.py, road_tracker.py and project.py have been developed by me for the purpose of the final year project.
  
  - ObjectAvoid.py contains the code that stops the car in front of an obstacle using the ultrasonic module.
  - road_tracker.py cotains the code that ensures the car follows a black line using the infrared sensors.
  - project.py combines the two codes above that creates the finalised self-driving car.
